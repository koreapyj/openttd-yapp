Some little changes:

 Statusbar height was increased by 2px to display big letters correctly with hungarian (or other) accents.


Small bugs:
 Trip history can't handle minutes and it always calculates in days.
 Town rating colours shows red labels incorrectly for the first month of the game.
 Industry station names can generate 2 nearby stations with the same name.
 There is no preview of huge airports in building menu when you don't use the hugeairports grf. Apart from this you can still build a fully working huge airport.
 Cargo related conditional orders is available for trains & road vehicles only.
 Town window shows wrong summary of passengers and mails.
 Patches Refit & TBTR are disabled in multiplayer to avoid desync.


I recommend to play YACD with Neighbours are important or Real growth gamescript to avoid a lot of PAX too quickly.
