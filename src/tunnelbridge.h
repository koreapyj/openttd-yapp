/**
 * Maximum height of bridge above ground.
 * Used when building bridges and terraforming below bridges.
 * Background: Before the more heightlevels patch, only bridges below height 15
 * were possible, simply because the landscape wasnÂ´t higher.  With more
 * heightlevels enabled, one can think about higher bridges in terms of landscape.
 * Unfortunately, if a bridge becomes higher than height 15, one will see serious
 * glitches.  Fixing them would be a fairly hard problem.  So, also as even more
 * high bridges are fairly unrealistic either and this is no restriction compared
 * to the situation before more heightlevels, the height of bridges is limited
 * to height 15.
